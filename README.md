# EnhancedMenu

This is an addon for World of Warcraft based on the original code from https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/enhancedmenu
Files are updated to include an option to open a popup window (instead of chatbox) with link to plyaer's WoW Progress link.
Also updated Armory box to be popup instead of a chat one.

Hope you appreciate my edit.
